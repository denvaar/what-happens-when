## What Happens When...

This project explores -- in as much detail as possible -- the sequence of events that take place when some action is performed on a computer.

Inspired mostly by [this repo](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when).

## Why?

- It's interesting.
- 2 learn stuff.
- It's fun to see all of the hidden details of something.
